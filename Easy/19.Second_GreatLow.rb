# Have the function SecondGreatLow(arr) take the array of numbers
# stored in arr and return the second lowest and second greatest
# numbers, respectively, separated by a space. For example: if arr
# contains [7, 7, 12, 98, 106] the output should be 12 98. The array
# will not be empty and will contain at least 2 numbers. It can get 
# tricky if there's just two numbers!
