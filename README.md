# _Coderbyte - Ruby Solutions_

_Here are a list of my solutions to the [Coderbyte](http://www.coderbyte.com) challenges, written in Ruby._

_These were written against the clock, so are not in the most readable form, I may revisit_
_them in the future to clean up the code.

## _Contribution_

_I'll continue to update them as I progress through the challenges, but feel_
_free to drop me a line if there's anything that you'd like to query or if you've_
_spotted a mistake.  I'm not a Ruby Guru, so would be happy to learn._
